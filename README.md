# üîê Password Strength Evaluation Project

This project involved a thorough, hands-on investigation into how password complexity affects security. Each step was carefully completed to ensure a deep understanding and practical insights.

## üöÄ Detailed Steps and Effort

### 1. Password Creation  
I thoughtfully crafted multiple passwords with varying complexity ‚Äî from simple lowercase words to long, mixed-character passwords including uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. This step was crucial to cover a wide spectrum of password strengths for testing.

### 2. Strength Testing  
Each password was individually tested using an online password strength checker tool. I carefully recorded the crack times and feedback provided by the tool to evaluate how effective different password elements were in improving security.

### 3. Analysis & Feedback Collection  
After testing, I analyzed the results by comparing passwords‚Äô scores and feedback comments. This helped me identify specific weaknesses in simpler passwords and understand how complexity influences strength.

### 4. Best Practices Identification  
Based on the analysis, I summarized clear and practical best practices for creating strong passwords. This involved researching and verifying advice to make sure the tips were reliable and useful for everyday security.

### 5. Research on Common Password Attacks  
To deepen the context, I researched common password attack methods such as brute force and dictionary attacks. I linked how these attacks exploit weak passwords and how complexity can protect against them.

### 6. Security Summary  
Finally, I compiled all findings to provide a summary that explains how password complexity directly affects security. This includes the importance of length, unpredictability, and character diversity for resisting hacking attempts.
